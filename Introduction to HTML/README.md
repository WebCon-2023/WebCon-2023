# Introduction to HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML provides a way to structure content on a web page by using tags and attributes.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document consists of several elements, including the ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration, ```<html>``` , ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags. Here is an example of a basic HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

* The ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` declaration at the beginning of the document tells the web browser that this is an HTML document.
* The ```<html>``` element is the root element of an HTML page.
* The ```<head>``` element contains information about the document, such as the title, metadata, and links to external files.
* The ```<body>``` element contains the visible content of the web page.

## HTML Tags

HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets '< >', and most tags have a corresponding closing tag, denoted by a forward slash '/' before the tag. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, like this: ```<tagname>```. Some tags have opening and closing tags, like this: ```<tagname>content</tagname>```. Other tags are self-closing, like this: ```<tagname />```.

Here are some common HTML tags:

```<html>```: The root element of an HTML document.

```<head>```: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.

```<body>```: Contains the visible content of the document.

```<h1>``` to ```<h6>```: Headings of different levels, with ```<h1>``` being the largest and ```<h6>``` being the smallest.

```<p>```: Paragraphs of text.

```<a>```: Links to other web pages or resources.

```<img>```: Images to be displayed on the page.

```<ul>``` and ```<ol>```: Unordered and ordered lists, respectively.

```<li>```: List items in a list.

```<table>```: A table of data.

```<form>```: A form to collect user input.

## HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are specified within the opening tag, like this: ```<tagname attribute="value">```. Some common attributes include:

* 'id': An identifier for the element.
* 'class': A class name for the element.
* 'href': The URL of a link.
* 'src': The URL of an image or other resource.
* 'alt': Alternate text to be displayed if an image cannot be loaded.
